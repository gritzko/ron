# RON UUID bit layout - compatibility

The bit layout is semi-compatible with RFC 4122.  The RFC reserves m.s. bits of
the 8th byte for the "variant". RON hijacks the 0 variant (NCS backward
compatibility) assuming no original Apollo UUIDs are still in circulation.

    vvvv ....  .... ....  .... ....  .... ....
    .... ....  .... ....  .... ....  .... ....
    00ss ....  .... ....  .... ....  .... ....
    .... ....  .... ....  .... ....  .... ....

`ss` bits stand for the "version" of the RON UUID.  `vvvv` stand for "variety"
within the version.  For example, version: event timestamp `10`, variety: RFC 4122
epoch `0010`.

The codes for versions and their varieties:

    00. human readable name
        0000. transcendental/hardcoded name (lww, rga)
              or a scoped name (myvar$gritzko)
        0001. ISBN (1/978$1400075997)
        0011. EAN-13 bar code (3/4006381$333931)
        0100. SI units (4/m, 4/kg)
        0101. zip codes (5/2628CD$NL, 5/620078$RU)
        1010. IATA airport code (A/LED)
        1011. ticker name (B/GOOG$NASDAQ)
        1100. ISO 4217 currency code (C/USD, C/GBP)
        1101. short DNS name (D/google$com)
        1110. E.164 intl phone num (E/7999$5631415)
        1111. ISO 3166 country code (F/RU, F/FRA...)

    01. number
        00. ?decimal index (up to 9999999999%, also 2D indices 4%5)
        01. cryptographic hash
            010. plain chunk hash
                 0100. SHA-2, first 120 bits
                 0101. SHA-3
            011. RFC 7574 Merkle hash
                 0110. ...SHA-2 based
                 0111. ...SHA-3 based
        10. random number (A/k3R9w_2F8w%Le~6dDScsw)
        11. crypto id, public key fingerprint ???

    10. event (Lamport timestamp, value and origin)
        00. Base64 calendar (MMDHmS...)
        01. Logical (4/00001, 70000000002...)
        10. Epoch (RFC 4122 epoch, 100ns since 1582)

        origin is a replica id, where variant specifies the replica id assignment rule:
        __00. trie-forked
        __01. crypto-forked
        __10. record-forked
        __11. application-specific

    11. derived event (timestamp, same as event)

Event/derived RON UUIDs are very much like RFC 4122 v1 time-based UUIDs.  The
difference is subtle but very important: RON event UUIDs are logical clocks.
They are *monotonous* and causally consistent. Practically speaking, RON UUIDs
assume an internet connection is/was available to somewhat synchronize the
clock.  A new RON event UUID is always greater than any past UUID.  A program
must reject any data with UUIDs "from the future".

8th byte's m.s. bit meanings are:

    00. RON UUID,
    01. internal: RON atom (int, float, string),
    10. RFC 4122 UUID,
    11. Microsoft something.

## Base64 rendering

Any UUID, including RFC 4122 UUIDs, could be Base64-serialized as 22 chars

    A0123456789 8abcdefghij

where the leading char is `0` to `F` in each half.  The half-separating space is
optional.  The Base64 serialization reproduces the bit layout, verbatim. 

For version `00` or variety `0000`, the leading char might be skipped.
(The separating whitespace becomes non-optional then.)

In case of RON UUIDs, the leading char denoting the version might be replaced by
one of four special characters (`$` for `00`, `%` for `01`, `+` for `10`, `-` for
`11`).

Each halve's tailing zeroes might be skipped.  Then, the leading char should be
separated by a slash `/`.  These are different renderings of the same UUID:

    ALED0000000 00000000000
    ALED000000000000000000
    ALED0000000 0000000000
    ALED0000000$0000000000
    ALED0000000
    A/LED000 0
    A/LED$0
    A/LED

In presence of context (previous UUIDs), UUIDs might be prefix-compressed.
